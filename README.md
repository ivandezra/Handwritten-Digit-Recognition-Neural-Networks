# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks

This project compares multiple models for identifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and comparison across various machine learning models.

## Models Used for Comparison:
- Logistic Regression
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Random Forest (Optional: Can be included if extended)
- Support Vector Machines (Optional)

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook with detailed steps.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing data, training models, and comparing results.
- `models/`: Holds any saved models and results.
- `images/`: Contains any result plots, such as model comparison plots.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
